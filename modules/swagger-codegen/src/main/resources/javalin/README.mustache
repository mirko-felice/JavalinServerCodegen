## Requirements

Building the server API stub requires:
1. Java 11+
2. Gradle

## Getting Started

The files generated define a stub for the server so it is needed to complete them with the desired behaviour.

## Documentation for API Endpoints

APIs generated lack of the behaviour implementation as mentioned before. The user that desires to complete this stub needs to implement the TODO section for each path request.
More documentation about APIs can be found in *api_doc.md* file.

## Documentation for Models

The structure of models can be found in *models_doc.md* file.

## Recommendation

It's recommended to take a look to the whole generated stub and make necessary changes to get the desired workflow of the final server.
